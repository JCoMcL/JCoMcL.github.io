At the beginning of 2024 I drew twelve circles on my whiteboard because I had spent the previous year drowning, and I needed something to change. Over the intervening year the system I had started grew to the full size that a whiteboard (and calendar) could realistically support, and given me a dozen new ways to look at how I run my life. I want to finally write down everything I have to say about the Dots System, but first, why would you want a Dots System.

Let's imagine you've graduated college and you have your whole life ahead of you. You want to look for a job, but at the same time you don't know if the job you're looking for is the job for you. You have a project, something that's been rattling around in your head for a while but you've put it off until you had time, and now you have time. You also want to learn an instrument, or practice one you've learned. You want to learn a language too. Infact, you have a pretty long list of things you want to learn because when you started college you kind of hoped that you'd know everything by the end and that didn't really happen.

Even if that doesn't sound very difficult to keep track of, let's imagine for the sake of argument that it is. Difficulty is not so bad, after all things are only difficult until someone makes it easy. That's the magical thing about computers; you encounter a difficulty, but you can imagine a solution, that solution becomes an idea, an idea becomes a project, and maybe one day a project becomes a product. Except when you pursue an idea, you encounter difficulty, which begets a new idea, which begets a new project, and each project is more important than the last because it is closer to the roots of all your problems. But also each project is more difficult than the last, and further from anything that - in practical terms - you care about. In no time at all, you've taken one little bit of friction in life, and turned it into a lifelong commitment to solve the most important thing ever in a long sequence of things that is next to impossible to describe.

This is the environment that the dots system was born out of. It may sound insane but it turned out to be fewer steps from sanity than it might seem, and those steps, I think, are steps that would benefit more people other than just myself to take.

See, In a given day, week, or year, you have only so much time, and only so much effort, and you have (at a conservative estimate) more than one thing deserving of your time and effort at any given moment. So here's what you do: write down some of those things, decide how much they're worth to you in the near future, convert that decision into a number, and draw that number of circles, or boxes, or place-markers of your choosing, after each item. These circles (or boxes, or place-markers of your choosing) tell you how many *dots* each *goal* is worth. What is a dot? It's a unit of time and effort, a unit of work, a marker of completion, or a marker of failure - a lesson learned. A dot is when you feel you've done enough, or done all you can, or done anything at all when you feared you would do nothing.

Your mission now is twofold: However many dots you have to fill, you must summon that many units of time and effort *and* you must direct those units of time, effort where they will award you your dots. This is the dots system in essence. The dots system in practice looks a little more like this ![](dots system at present). But ignore that for now. I'll talk about how and why it got it grew the way it did but even in simplest form there's a lot to be said.

Almost immediately into my new dotted life, I became aware of a truth that I wish I'd known all my life: Linear thinking is a complete fallacy. I had a *particularly* bad habit of it but I have known many more people than myself to make the misjudgement "I want to to X, but it I really ought to do Y, so I will do Y first then X", and then obviously procede to do neither Y nor X.
After a year of dots, I can say with pride that linear thinking feels alien to me now. Thinking about the things you have to do as being all in a line ranked from most pressing to least is a natural way to reduce the complexity of having more than one thing deserving of your time and effort. The problem with it is that it sucks. It sucks for obvious reasons like how manifestly blocks you off from your goals by putting the hardest thing right at the front, but it sucks for some other, interesting reasons too.
You may be tempted to put off some goal or task until you feel like you're ready, like you know enough, or have the tools, or the time, or the processes in place to manage it, but in doing so you give up on a valuable lens through which to view your problem. It may not be a very broad or a very clear lens but it's lens, and once have two lenses on a problem that's when you really start to be able to make insights about it. That's called depth-perception.
![It is much harder to make an illusion which stands up to scrutiny from multiple viewpoints]()
If something is important, it's worth trying now. If it's to be postponed it can be postponed, but only after you try enough to know what to postpone for. A nibble here and there might not add up to much, but you get the shape of it far quicker than you'd think and before long you're ready to take your first big bite.

The second thing I realized is that I had inadvertently created and amazingly accurate metric of how well my life was going. It wasn't just a useful abstraction, it was actually the closest thing to the ground truth. Pursuing my dots almost always was better way to accomplish my goals than pursuing my goals directly. What this means is that once the dots system had matured enough I just had to start trusting it, even against my own judgement. Having this system for scoring how well I was living my life feels like when I first learned to use version control software; there is a clarity and security I get from having visibility on everything I've done that is sometimes to justify needing, but very difficult to give up once you've gotten used to it. I sometimes hear stories of people who have goals to accomplish or standard to try and hold themselves to and they have no empricial answer to the question of "how well is it going?". Without actually knowing, the uncertainty tends leave room for whatever feelings you want to feel depending on your disposition; be it fruitless self-loathing or recourseless self-forgiveness.

## The Dots System in more detail

I've trying to speak in abstract terms so far about actually implementing the system. Concretely speaking, I like one week as the timescale for a designation of dots. A deadline isn't a neccesary part of the system; you can just take as long as it takes to accomplish your dots and let the time it takes be how you score yourself. I like the dots system to by a statement of an ideal, something that is either achieved or not achieved, and for that purpose I do need it to be strictly bounded in time. I will face failure as many times as I need to.,
I write out my dots on the whiteboard, and after Tuesday the window for edits closes.

### Emergency Dots

One of the things that can suck about having a rigid goal that is decided at the start of the week is that it can make you feel bad for deviating from your defined goal to deal with unforseens. The Emergency Dots are essentially a buffer of extra dots that I can award myself for things that I might not have been able to know would have been important at the beginning of the week (a long-winded way of saying "emergencies"). It is a fixed amount of open-ended flexibility; something you need in a system like this but in practice not something very much of. Three per week was the sweet spot for me.

### Soft Dots

Taking the idea of emergency dots and expanding them to add flexibility everywhere else. The *Hard Dots* reflect our exact hopes for the week and then additional *Soft Dots* set a limit on how many dots we can earn from a single category, giving fine grained control of the amount of flexibility we want to allow. The total number of Hard Dots is now our quota, but we can reach our quota in quite a lot of different ways. This creates an interesting dynamic as, with so many combinations resulting in a success state, some types of success start to feel more valuable than others.
I came up with these three tiers of success:

|||
|-|-|
|Level 1 |Earn enough dots to reach the quota|
|Level 2 |Fill every Hard dot|
|Level 3 |Earn every available dot|

Cool idea, but in practice it hasn't really come into play all that much. Even a Level 1 success is pretty tough in my system. I've begun to acknowledge an imaginary Level 0 success whereby I'm still motivated and pursuing dots by the end of the week, even that is a pretty good outcome.

### Big and Little Dots
It became clear pretty quickly that not all dots were created equal and I needed the system to be able to differentiate between hours of creatively taxing work and household chores. Excess big dots were worth one little dot, but excess little dots were not transferable to big dots, meaning that a *Level 1* success now means meeting our big dot quota and our total dot quota.
A little dot could be achieved very little work, often incidentally, which brought about a sort of paradigm shift in the dots. I began to find ways to reward myself with dots for almost anything I did, even things I would have done anyway. Although this inflated the currency of dots, it was nice to have some small record of a job well done, and the more the system could encapsulate, the more I could trust that a *dot* was actually something valuable that I should pursue.

### Bounties
The more I began to rely on the Dots System, the more I found that important todos which were not adequately incentivised by it were piling up. Bounties were an attempt to solve that by awarding a generous number of dots for the completion of a task. This, of course, resulted in even more *dot inflation*, but that can be a good thing if it gives me more opportunities to reward myself. Human motivation is a finicky thing and one should certainly not make the mistake of assuming it follows any of the rules of economics.
One of the interesting things about bounties from a sort-of game design perspective is that dots from bounties are not mutually exclusive with other categories of dots. I can get my bounty dots for completing a task and also get regular dots for working on the task. This can lead to some fun strategies to try and get disproportionate dots gains by comboing the different reward systems. It may sound like an exploit, but if the system actually reflects your goals than this is a way to accomplish your goals by working smarter not harder, as it were.

## Ups and Downs

2024 has been the best documented year of my life thus far which, in the long run, may end up being the most substantial impact that this system will have had. I don't quite know how this essay might have turned out if I didn't have a record to look back on describing how exactly it went over the course of the entire year (perhaps one day I will have a better mental model for the ways in which my memory wil tend to betray me) but I probably wouldn't have had much to write for this section. One of my prior attempts at getting a handle on my life was a project called [Peer Pressure Club](/off-record/peer-pressure-club). The idea was to have place where I, and anyone else who wanted to be part of it, could write about our plans, report on how they went and be held accountable by our peers for what we say. The idea never worked quite how I'd hoped because I was never able to find anyone who was looking for quite the same thing that I was but the structure of it ended up being very useful just as a journal. Keeping a journal is not strictly a part of the dots sytem but it ended up being perfect format for one, being as information-dense as it was.

My earliest worries about the system, as I was still in the process of inventing it, were that the inherent ambiguity might become a vehicle for self loathing, and that the system would work only for a little while until I became adapt at ignoring it at which point it would just be an inconvenience like so many of my prior attempts. Thankfully neither of these worries came to fruition.

One thing about the Dots System is that you really have to be able to motivate yourself to seek after abstract things in order for it to work. You have to actually be able to value a dot, to feel as though a dot is a wortwhile reward for your efforts. Most people are able to value and pursue abstract things but I'm not so sure that most can do so on command. I trusted that I was able, but on my twelfth week, I felt I had hit the limits of these abilities. Looking back on what I wrote on the matter, though, it's clear now that what I was facing was not a difficulty with the dots system but a difficulty with life that was expressed through the system since the system was a measure of my life. I wrote as much myself:

> Sometimes I suspect that my problem is that I've expertly trained myself to be unhappy, so that I can keep chasing an impossible goal. I've heard many times that happiness is not something you can find, it's something you have to choose. I've been afraid of choosing happiness because it would mean giving up on all the aspirations that only I can accomplish.
> the thing that kind scares me is that I don't know whether my moments of despair are a momentary lapse in my otherwise good mental health, or a momentary clarity from my otherwise delusional reality model, and I'm not sure how to find out or if there's even a difference

Anyway, I'm pleased to report that I don't feel this way anymore. I think this was a lingering issue with the linear way in which I prioritized things which, even after I discovered the fallacy, still took the whole year to iron out.

It was on the 32nd week of the year, after a few close calls, a lot of not-so-close calls , and more than a couple of weeks where I didn't do the the Dots System at all, that I finally got my first Level 1 success. Reading what I wrote at the time still makes my heart do a little fist pump.

> I usually dislike Fridays because it's usually the day that I realize that I don't have enough time to complete my dots, this Friday was different...
today was the day I got a good night's sleep and finally put into motion all of the plans I had been procrastinating.
![](friday.jpg)

I had insisted pretty early on that I would not move the goalposts; that the Dots System was a statement of ideal and I would have to grow to fill it. I actually did get to see this growth slowly take place over the course of the year. That is still the only Level 1 sucess I have achieved thus far, however nowadays I'm coming pretty close pretty consistently. That said, I still feel like setting achievable goals does more good at least in the short term, and after a year of using the system I feel like I have enough of an idea about what a dot is worth that if I really want a long term way of tracking productivity, counting dots ought to be good enough.

Counting dots, as it turns out, is something I want to be able to do a lot more of. The idea of computerizing the system has occured to me many times over the course of using it and there are a lot of obvious advantages: I'd be able to access the system from a bunch of different endpoints instead of just my whiteboard (or occasionaly my notepad), which might alleviate some of the issues with untracked and forgotten dots, but on a larger scale, would cut my tether to the whiteboard on which the system lives without requiring that I plan far enough ahead to have crafted a Portable Dots System. There are analogue solutions to this problem but they come with costs. I got so used to the idea of using a Dots System to manage complexity that at times when I had a [complex project](https://github.com/jcomcl/autogentoo) to work on I found myself wishing I had a dots system just for that one proejct. This happens to be something that (well designed) software is really good at - recursibility. I can imagine a dots system set up to describe the work to be done on a project, and the dots achieved in that system percolate up to the main system where they are represented by as single row. This could end up being a pretty decent semi-formal project management tool and it could be collaborated on over the internet unlike a whiteboard.

The real benefit to software Dots would be the visiblity it could give me to have *everything* tracked and queryable. The first Dots System I ever did, right at the beginning, I color coded the dots I filled by day of the week. I didn't know why I would need that information at the time, I just had a gut feeling. As it turns out it is useduly for all kinds of things, especially when you start to consider the system as a record as much as a guide. Well with software, I wouldn't have to decide what I was color-coding according to, I could track anything I wanted, and figure out after-the-fact what data was valuable enough to display upfront. Whatever I wanted, I could count it, graph it, correlate it with sentiment-analysis of my weekly reports. It would be an *insane* amount of visibility on my life, now that I know how valuable even a little can be. I would love to be eriting another one of these in two years with that kind of retrospective analysis.

I actually already began writing a software implementation of the Dots System. I gave it about three big dots worth of effort before it became clear that, while it would be pretty easy to make something that worked, it would be very difficult to make something that worked wellenough that I wouldn't miss the whiteboard. It turns out there is *a lot* of stuff that you get for free when working with a paper (adjacent) system. I've got lots more to say on the matter but I'll hold my tongue until I've something to show too.
