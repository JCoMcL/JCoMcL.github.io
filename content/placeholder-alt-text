If you're blind, I'm sorry that happened man, that sucks
This image is honestly not that important
A picture's worth a thousand words, and I've only got so many words in me
It's a picture of your house, taken last wednesday from the bushes outside
You're not missing much, trust me.
A picture of that which you most desire. Come closer, reach out your hand. Your fingers grasp at nothing.
A picture B-)
A html img tag with a src attribute pointing to a uri of a png of a photo that I took of something-or-other.
It probably doesn't matter
