At the beginning of 2024 I drew twelve circles on my whiteboard because I had spent the previous year drowning and I needed something to change. Over the intervening year the system I had started grew to the full size that a whiteboard (and calendar) could realistically suppport, and given a hundred new way to think about my life. But first, why would you want a Dots System.

Let's imagine you've graduated college and you have your whole life ahead of you. You want to look for a job, but at the same time you don;'t know if the job you;'re looking for is the job for you. You have a project, something that's been rattling around in your head for a while but you've put it off until you had time, and now you have time. You also want to learn an instrument, or practice one you've learned. You want to learn a language too. Infact, you have a pretty long list of things you want to learn because when you started college you kind of hoped that you'd know everything by the end and that didn't really happen.

Even if that doesn't sound very difficult to keep track of, let's imagine for the sake of argument that it is. Difficulty is not so bad, after all things are only difficult until someone makes it easy. That's the magical thing about computers; you encounter a difficulty, but you can imagine a solution, that solution becomes an idea, an idea becomes a project, and maybe one day a project becomes a product. Except when you pursue an idea, you encounter difficulty, which begets a now idea, which begets a new project, and each project is more important than the last because it is closer to the roots of all your problems. But also each project is more difficult than the last, and further from anything that, in practical terms, you care about. In no time at all, you've taken one little bit of friction in life, and turned it into a lifelong commitment to solve the most important thing ever, and everything has to be done in a very specifc order or it was all for nothing.

If this sounds insane to you, you're half right; half of you has a much healthier relationship to struggle than I had when I had finished college (and the other half of you doesn't dare to dream).

In a given day, week, or year, you have only so much time, and only so much effort. You have (at a conservative estimate) more than one thing deserving of your time and effort at any given moment. Here's what you do: write down some of those things, decide how much they're worth to you in the near future, convert that decision into a number, and draw that nubmer of circles, or boxes, or place-markers of your choosing, after each item. These circles (or boxes, or place-markers of your choosing) tell you how many *dots* each *goal* is worth. What is a dot? It's a unit of time and effort, a unit of work, a marker of completion, or a marker of failure - a lesson learned. A dot is when you feel you've done enough, or done all you can, or done anything at all when you feared you would do nothing.

Your mission now is twofold: However many dots you have to fill, you must summon that many units of time and effort *and* you must direct those units of time, effort and work where they will award you your dots. This is the dots sytem in essence. The dots system in practice looks a little more like this ![](dots system at present). But ignore that for now. I'll talk about how and why it got complicated but even in simplest form there's a lot to be said.

Almost immediately into my new dotted life, I became aware of a truth that I wish I'd known all my life: Linear thinking is a complete fallacy. I had a *particularly* bad habit of it but I have known many more people than myself to make the misjudgement "I want to to X, but it I really ought to do Y, so I will do Y first then X", and then obviously proceding to do neither Y nor X.
After a year of dots, I can say with pride that linear thinking feels alien to me now. Thinking about the things you have to do as being all in a line ranked from most pressing to least is a natural way to reduce the complexity of having more than one thing deserving of your time and effort. The problem with it is that it sucks. It sucks for obvious reasons like how manifestly blocks you off from your goals by putting the hardest thing right at the front, but it sucks for some other, interesting reasons too.
You may be tempted to put off some goal or task until you feel like you're ready, like you know enough, or have the tools, or the time, or the processes in place to manage it, but in doing so you give up on a valuable lens through which to view your problem. It may not be a very broad or a very clear lens but it's lens, and once have two lenses on a problem that's when you really start to be able to make insights about it. That's called depth-perception.
![It is much harder to make an illusion which stands up to scrutiny from multiple viewpoints]()
If something is important, it's worth trying now. If it's to be postponed it can be postponed, but only after you try enough to know what to postpone for. A nibble here and there might not add up to much, but you get the shape of it far quicker than you'd think and before long you're ready to take your first big bite.

The second thing I realized is that I had inadvertently created and amaingly accurate metric of how well my life was going. It wasn't just a useful abstraction, it was actually the closest thing to the ground truth. Pursuing my dots almost always was better way to accomplish my goals than pursuing my goals directly. To say "I got all of my dots this week, it was a pretty good week for me" is redundant, because dots *are* the de facto measure of whetehr it was or was not a good week. What this means is that once I had brought the dots system had matured enough, I just had to start trusting it, even against my judgement.
