At the beginning of 2024 I drew twelve circles on my whiteboard because I had spent the previous year drowning, and I needed something to change. Over the intervening year the system I had started grew to the full size that a whiteboard (and calendar) could realistically suppport, and given a hundred new way to think about my life. But first, why would you want a Dots System.

Let's imagine you've graduated college and you have your whole life ahead of you. You want to look for a job, but at the same time you don;'t know if the job you;'re looking for is the job for you. You have a project, something that's been rattling around in your head for a while but you've put it off until you had time, and now you have time. You also want to learn an instrument, or practice one you've learned. You want to learn a language too. Infact, you have a pretty long list of things you want to learn because when you started college you kind of hoped that you'd know everything by the end and that didn't really happen.

Even if that doesn't sound very difficult to keep track of, let's imagine for the sake of argument that it is. Difficulty is not so bad, after all things are only difficult until someone makes it easy. That's the magical thing about computers; you encounter a difficulty, but you can imagine a solution, that solution becomes an idea, an idea becomes a project, and maybe one day a project becomes a product. Except when you pursue an idea, you encounter difficulty, which begets a now idea, which begets a new project, and each project is more important than the last because it is closer to the roots of all your problems. But also each project is more difficult than the last, and further from anything that, in practical terms, you care about. In no time at all, you've taken one little bit of friction in life, and turned it into a lifelong commitment to solve the most important thing ever, and everything has to be done in a very specifc order or it was all for nothing.

If this sounds insane to you, you're half right; half of you has a much healthier relationship to struggle than I had when I had finished college (and the other half of you doesn't dare to dream).

In a given day, week, or year, you have only so much time, and only so much effort. You have (at a conservative estimate) more than one thing deserving of your time and effort at any given moment. Here's what you do: write down some of those things, decide how much they're worth to you in the near future, convert that decision into a number, and draw that nubmer of circles, or boxes, or place-markers of your choosing, after each item. These circles (or boxes, or place-markers of your choosing) tell you how many *dots* each *goal* is worth. What is a dot? It's a unit of time and effort, a unit of work, a marker of completion, or a marker of failure - a lesson learned. A dot is when you feel you've done enough, or done all you can, or done anything at all when you feared you would do nothing.

Your mission now is twofold: However many dots you have to fill, you must summon that many units of time and effort *and* you must direct those units of time, effort and work where they will award you your dots. This is the dots sytem in essence. The dots system in practice looks a little more like this ![](dots system at present). But ignore that for now. I'll talk about how and why it got complicated but even in simplest form there's a lot to be said.

Almost immediately into my new dotted life, I became aware of a truth that I wish I'd known all my life: Linear thinking is a complete fallacy. I had a *particularly* bad habit of it but I have known many more people than myself to make the misjudgement "I want to to X, but it I really ought to do Y, so I will do Y first then X", and then obviously proceding to do neither Y nor X.
After a year of dots, I can say with pride that linear thinking feels alien to me now. Thinking about the things you have to do as being all in a line ranked from most pressing to least is a natural way to reduce the complexity of having more than one thing deserving of your time and effort. The problem with it is that it sucks. It sucks for obvious reasons like how manifestly blocks you off from your goals by putting the hardest thing right at the front, but it sucks for some other, interesting reasons too.
You may be tempted to put off some goal or task until you feel like you're ready, like you know enough, or have the tools, or the time, or the processes in place to manage it, but in doing so you give up on a valuable lens through which to view your problem. It may not be a very broad or a very clear lens but it's lens, and once have two lenses on a problem that's when you really start to be able to make insights about it. That's called depth-perception.
![It is much harder to make an illusion which stands up to scrutiny from multiple viewpoints]()
If something is important, it's worth trying now. If it's to be postponed it can be postponed, but only after you try enough to know what to postpone for. A nibble here and there might not add up to much, but you get the shape of it far quicker than you'd think and before long you're ready to take your first big bite.

The second thing I realized is that I had inadvertently created and amaingly accurate metric of how well my life was going. It wasn't just a useful abstraction, it was actually the closest thing to the ground truth. Pursuing my dots almost always was better way to accomplish my goals than pursuing my goals directly. What this means is that once the dots system had matured enough I just had to start trusting it, even against my own judgement.

## The Dots System in more detail

I've been using very abstract language so far. Concretely speaking, I like one week as the timescale for a designation of dots. A deadline isn't a neccesary part of the system; you can just take as long as it takes to accomplish your dots and let the time it takes be how you score yourself. I like the dots system to by a statement of an ideal, something that is either achieved or not achieved, and for that purpose I do need it to be strictly bounded in time. I will face failure as many times as I need to.,
I write out my dots on the whiteboard, and after Tuesday the window for edits closes.


### Emergency Dots

One of the things that can suck about having a rigid goal that is decided at the start of the week is that it can make you feel bad for deviating from your defined goal to deal with unforseens. The Emergency Dots are essentially a buffer of extra dots that I can award myself for things that I might not have been able to know would have been important at the beginning of the week (a long-winded way of saying "emergenices"). It is a fixed amount of open-ended flexibility; something you need in a system like this but in practice not something very much of. Three per week was the sweet spot for me.

### Soft Dots

Taking the idea of emergency dots and expanding them to add flexibility everywhere else. The *Hard Dots* reflect our exact hopes for the week and then additional *Soft Dots* set a limit on how many dots we can earn from a single category, giving fine grained control of the amount of flexibility we want to allow. The total number of Hard Dots is now our qouta, but we can reach our qouta in quite a lot of different ways. This creates an interesting dynamic as, with so many combinations resulting in a success state, some types of success start to feel more valuable than others.
I came up with these three tiers of success:
|-|-|
|Level 1 |Earn enough dots to reach the quota|
|Level 2 |Fill every Hard dot|
|Level 3 |Earn every avialable dot|

Cool idea, but in practice it hasn't really come into play all that much. Even a Level 1 success is pretty tough in my system. I've begun to acknowledge an imaginary Level 0 success whereby I'm still motivated and pursuing dots by the end of the week, even that is a pretty good outcome.


### Big and Little Dots
It became clear pretty quickly that not all dots were created equal and I needed the system to be able to differentiate between hours of creatively taxing work and household chores. Excess big dots were worth one little dot, but excess little dots were not transferable to big dots, meaning that a *Level 1* success now means meeting our big dot quota and our total dot quota.
A little dot could be achieved very little work, often incedentally, which brought about a sort of paradigm shift in the dots. I began to find ways to reward myself with dots for almost anything I did, even things I would have done anyway. Although this inflated the currency of dots, it was nice to have some small record of a job well done, and the more the system could encapsulate, the more I could trust that a *dot* was actually something valuable that I should pursue.

### Bounties
The more I began to rely on the Dots System, the more I found that important todos which were not adequately incentivised by it were piling up. Bounties were an attempt to solve that by awarding a generous number of dots for the completion of a task. This, of course, resulted in even more *dot inflation*, but that can be a good thing if it gives me more opportunities to reward msyelf. Human motivation is a finnicky thing and one should certainly not make the mistake of assuming it follows any of the rules of economics.
One of the interesting things about bounties from a sort-of game design perspective is that dots from bounties are not mutually exclusive with other categories of dots. I can get my bounty dots for completing a task and also get regular dots for working on the task. This can lead to some fun strategies to try and get disproportionate dots gains by comboing the different reward systems. It may sound like an expoit, but if the system actually reflects your goals than this is a way to accomplish your goals by working sarter not harder, as it were.
